## 🌟 UI Bonus Improvements Added by Me

These enhancements were **not mandatory in the task**, but I implemented them for better UX:

🔹 Fully modern **Glass-Card Design**  
🔹 **Circular progress fill animation**  
🔹 **Blue bordered tick circle in pending state** → Clear click-to-complete hint  
🔹 **Green filled circle with white tick when completed**  
🔹 **Soft hover & scale animation on buttons**  
🔹 **Chip badges for category with dynamic colors**  
🔹 **Smooth slide-in animations for tasks**

> The goal was to build a **clean, minimal and visually appealing app that feels premium**.
